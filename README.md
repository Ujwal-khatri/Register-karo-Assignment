# My Frontend Developer Assignment

## 📝 About This Project
This project was built as part of my **Frontend Developer Assessment**, where I was required to develop a **homepage UI** based on the provided **Figma design**. The goal was to ensure **design accuracy, responsiveness, and performance optimization** while deploying the project on **Vercel**.

## 🎯 My Approach
- **React.js** for a modular and scalable structure.
- **CSS** to ensure pixel-perfect styling.
- **Media Queries** for full **responsiveness** across different screen sizes.
- **Optimized Performance** to meet **90+ PageSpeed Insights score**.
- **Deployed on Vercel** for real-world accessibility.
